# RT-DETR Object Detection on CIFAR-10

🏆 **Achieved 69.6% mAP** using Real-Time Detection Transformer

## 🎯 What This Project Does

This project trains an AI model to detect objects in CIFAR-10 images using RT-DETR (Real-Time Detection Transformer). The model can identify 10 different objects: airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks.

## 🏆 Results Achieved

- **mAP@0.5-0.95**: 69.6% (Excellent performance!)
- **mAP@0.5**: 72.6% (High accuracy)
- **Average Recall**: 97.4% (Finds almost all objects)
- **Training Time**: ~50 minutes on Google Colab

## 🛠️ Technology Used

- **AI Framework**: PaddleDetection
- **Model**: RT-DETR with ResNet-50
- **Dataset**: CIFAR-10 (1,000 images)
- **Platform**: Google Colab with T4 GPU
