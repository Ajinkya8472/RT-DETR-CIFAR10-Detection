# Results Folder

This folder contains the outputs and evaluation results from training the RT-DETR model on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Contents

- `training_metrics.md`: Summary of training performance metrics such as mAP, recall, loss curves, and training time.
- `sample_predictions/`: A collection of images from the validation set with bounding boxes and class labels predicted by the trained model.
- `model_performance.json`: JSON file containing detailed evaluation metrics and statistics.

## Usage

- Review `training_metrics.md` to understand the model's performance over epochs.
- Inspect images in `sample_predictions/` to visually assess detection quality.
- Use `model_performance.json` for programmatic access to evaluation results.

This folder helps in analyzing and presenting the effectiveness of the RT-DETR model on CIFAR-10 object detection tasks.
